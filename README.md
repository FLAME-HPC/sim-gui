Readme

This is SIM-GUI, a GUI for generating FLAME simulations and post-generation data processing.
The version is a refactoring of the original java code of SIM-GUI.

VERSION HISTORY:

SIM-GUI v0.9a 
(c) 2014 Philipp Harting

SIM-GUI v1.0
(c) 2014 Philipp Harting, Bohgdan Pukalskyi

Features:
- This version is template based. In SIM-GUI v0.9a the java code and code to generate the bash scripts were mixed inside the java code.
In this version all bash scripts are templates, cleanly separating the two code bases. This allows to adapt the bash script templates without having to change any of the java code.
